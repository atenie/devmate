* Spring Initializr was used for the project init. I _think_ that's normal procedure. Not entirely sure.
* Password data type is "text", although it should normally be chkpass. Many others should be char, but for the sake of the demo, I'll be using text.
* I'll be using the opening price as a value for "price", since this is what Google seems to be using.
* A good way this might be worth testing is via some crypto item, since stocks have a schedule whilst crypto never sleeps.
* No ID autoincrement reset. No idea how that would be _properly_ implemented.
