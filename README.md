# Devmate project

"You need to design and implement an application that should allow the users to
receive price changes alarms when the Stock price changes reach their defined
thresholds."

I've used Java Spring for the backend part, ReactJS for the frontend, and there is a Amazon AWS RDS solution with the credentials in the application.properties file.
If I forgot some credentials of any kind, please notify me.

How to run:
        
    To run the Spring project, load up IntelliJ or check out the mvnw.cmd (for Windows) or mvnw (for Unix-derived OSs).
    To run the React part of the project, enter the "frontend" folder with your console/terminal and run "npm start".
